        "Dropout is a regularization technique for neural network models proposed by Srivastava, et al. in their 2014 paper Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overﬁtting. \n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. They are dropped-out randomly. This means that their contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass. \n",
        "\n",
        "As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network. Weights of neurons are tuned for speciﬁc features providing some specialization. Neighboring neurons become to rely on this specialization, which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. \n",
        "\n",
        "This reliant on context for a neuron during training is referred to as complex co-adaptations. You can imagine that if neurons are randomly dropped out of the network during training, that other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons. This is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network. \n",
        "\n",
        "The effect is that the network becomes less sensitive to the speciﬁc weights of neurons. This in turn results in a network that is capable of better generalization and is less likely to overﬁt the training data.\n"

The baseline neural network model has two hidden layers, the ﬁrst with 60 units and the second with 30.
